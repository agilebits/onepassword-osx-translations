1Password is your password and identity companion. It leaps past simple password storage because 1Password works directly with your browser, saves your user names and passwords, and effortlessly creates strong, unique passwords for each site. 1Password can then automatically and securely log you in, enter credit card information, and fill registration forms, all while encrypting your information with the one password you need to remember. 

NOTE: for existing 1Password 3.8 users. For better results, please delete the old copy of 1Password before installing the version from the Mac App Store.
